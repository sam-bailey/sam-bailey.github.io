Hi there! I'm Sam Bailey, and I'm a Principal Data Scientist at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com). My day job involves a lot of python, statistics, and randomised controlled trials.

But in my free time, I like to explore new topics that catch my interest. That usually involves writing some [python](https://www.python.org/) or [julia](https://julialang.org/), whether it's coding something from scratch or just testing out a new library.

At the end of the day, I try to put my thoughts into words and share them on this blog. I hope you find my musings interesting and maybe even useful! Thanks for stopping by.
