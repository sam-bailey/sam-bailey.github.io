Hi there! I'm Sam Bailey, a Data Scientist at [Google](https://www.google.com), and previously at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com). My day job involves a lot of python, statistics, machine learning and experimentation.

But in my free time, I like to explore new data science topics that catch my interest. That usually involves writing some [python](https://www.python.org/) or [julia](https://julialang.org/), whether it's coding something from scratch or just testing out a new library.

At the end of the day, I try to put my thoughts into words and share them on this blog. Don't expect regular posts or peer-reviewed quality, think of this as more of a semi-organised brain-dump. Enjoy!
