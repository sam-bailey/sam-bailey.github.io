The distribution of the metric is highly skewed, with lots of zeros, then some \"normal\" spenders, and then a very small number of extreme spenders - we'll call these our outliers.

[Cuped](https://booking.ai/how-booking-com-increases-the-power-of-online-experiments-with-cuped-995d186fff1d) is a very effective method of reducing the variance of your metric based on data from before the start of your experiment. It's always worth trying and it's about as close to a free lunch as you can get when it comes to improving A/B testing power. However, cuped reduces variance, not skew, so it's likely your power will still be hindered by the outliers.\n",
        "1. If the previous two steps doesn't reduce your variance sufficiently, then it's time to look at trimming or winsorizing. These are very powerful techniques, but come with a large drawback: **you are introducing bias into your estimates**. This is especially problematic because here we are trimming or winsorizing on one side only (removing extremely high values) - you have no outliers on the lower side of the distribution.\n",

        "This is because when you transform your metric, you also change the null hypothesis you are testing and therefore the interpretation of any effect you measure. For revenue, you really care about the effect on the **(arithmetic) mean** revenue per visitor, because improving this is what will translate into improving total revenue. However, the log transform means you are testing for an effect on the **geometric mean**, which is not the same and improving it does not necessarily translate into improving your bottom line, leading to potentially bad business decisions.\n",

With trimming, you filter out all samples that are above some threshold, while with winsorizing you apply a cap, so that all values above a threshold are capped to that threshold. Both are very effective at reducing  variance, however because you are removing or capping the top X data points, you introduce a potentially large negative bias, so I usually treat it as a bit of a last resort.\n",

        "* The simple mean is the least biased of all the methods, but does not have good coverage or standardised MSE, indicating that the confidence intervals would not work well for this estimator, breaking our A/B tests.\n",
        "* The trimmed and winsorized means both behave as expected. The more we trim, the bias increases, and the variance decreases. Overall, the increase in bias is larger than the decrease in variance, meaning that the MSE gets worse. And the bias is so large that the coverage is terrible - the confidence intervals never contain the true population mean. This demonstrates why the trimmed and winsorized means are so difficult to use, because while the variance decreases, you introduce significant bias.\n",
        "* Our new estimators seem to work well, as long as the trimming quantile is not too large. Both have good coverage and standardised MSE, meaning that can be more reliably used as A/B testing metrics. The variance, bias and MSE are closer to the values for the simple mean. This means we get similar performance on average, but with a better behaved estimator that we can construct reliable confidence intervals for.\n",
        "* The hill tail estimator works better than the GPD tail estimator as long as the trimming quantile is kept below ~1%. Above that, the coverage of the hill estimator deteriorates, while the GPD tail estimator maintains its coverage until ~10%. This is expected because the GPD tail estimator is a more general distribution, so can describe a bigger portion of the tail which is not exactly Pareto distributed. \n",

        "\n",
        "Overall, based on this, I think the hill estimator has the most promise. While it breaks down at high trimming quantiles, as long as the correct trimming quantile is chosen it works well. It is also computationally simpler than the GPD estimator, because it has an analytical solution.\n",
