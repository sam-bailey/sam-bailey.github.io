My day job involves a lot of python, statistics, and randomised controlled trials.\nBut in my free time, I like to explore new topics that catch my interest. That usually involves writing some python or julia, whether it’s coding something from scratch or just testing out a new library.\nAt the end of the day, I try to put my thoughts into words and share them on this blog. I hope you find my musings interesting and maybe even useful! Thanks for stopping by.\nThis text was edited by ChatGPT, with the prompt “Make this sound like a light hearted, ‘about me’ section of a blog”."
