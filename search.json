    "text": "Hi there! I’m Sam Bailey, and I’m a Principal Data Scientist at Booking.com. My day job involves a lot of python, statistics, and randomised controlled trials.\nBut in my free time, I like to explore new topics that catch my interest. That usually involves writing some python or julia, whether it’s coding something from scratch or just testing out a new library.\nAt the end of the day, I try to put my thoughts into words and share them on this blog. I hope you find my musings interesting and maybe even useful! Thanks for stopping by.\nThis text was edited by ChatGPT, with the prompt “Make this sound like a light hearted, ‘about me’ section of a blog”."

    "text": "In a lot of situations we have 1-D data which is skewed, and we want to remove the outliers on the right. This happens a lot when running experiments with continuous variables like revenue, where you can have a few data points which are very high revenue and hurt your variance a lot. Removing these outliers improves your variance a lot."

    "text": "Generate toy dataset\nTo test these methods, I need some synthetic data. I’ll generate a mixture of a log-normal distribution and a Pareto distribution. The lognormal represents most users, but the Pareto represents the outliers. The pareto is especially problematic for statistics, since it has infinite variance, meaning the CLT won’t work."

This is for the bulk data, and is non-parametric so it should work on any dataset. I need to choose a kernel, for this data I’ll choose lognormal.\nA generalized pareto distribution. This should model the outliers."
