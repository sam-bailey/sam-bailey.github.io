  description: How can a two sided marketplace run experiments that generate insights for both sides of the marketplace simultaneously? At booking.com I developed an experiment design where we randomise customer + accommodation provider combinations into control and treatment groups, instead of only customers or only accommodation providers. This design generates unique insights, and allowed us to learn the impact a feature is having on both sides of our marketplace from a single experiment.

  description: When running online controlled experiments (A/B testing), ensuring that your experiment is sensitive enough to changes in your decision making metric is crucial. However, if your metric is very noisy, this can mean running your A/B tests for a long time, slowing down development velocity. In this project I developed a method to increase the sensitivity of A/B tests, and therefore reduce experiment runtimes, by applying a simple rank transforming on your metric.

  description: A novel experimental analysis method has been developed, making use of the continuous wavelet transform and machine learning to rapidly identify alpha-clustering in nuclei in regions of high nuclear state density. This technique was applied to resonant scattering measurements of the 4-He(40,44,48-Ca, alpha) resonant reactions, allowing the ùõº-cluster structure of 44,48,52-Ti to be investigated. Fragmented alpha-clustering was identified in 44-Ti and 52-Ti, while the results for 48-Ti were less conclusive, but suggest no such clustering.

  description: A novel technique has been developed, making use of the continuous wavelet transform to identify Œ±-clustered states from resonant scattering measurements in regions of high nuclear state density. This technique expedites the investigation of Œ± clustering in medium mass and heavy nuclei where the role that Œ± clustering plays in the structure of the nucleus is poorly understood. Here, we report the application of this technique to measurements of the 4-He(40, 44, 48-Ca, Œ±) resonant reactions, leading to an assessment of the Œ±-cluster structure of 44, 48, 52-Ti. Clustering involving Œ± particles was identified in 44-Ti and 52-Ti but was observed to break down in 48-Ti. The implications of these results are discussed.

  description: Measurements were made of the 4-He(40,44,48-Ca,Œ±) resonant scattering reactions at 180 degrees and up to E ‚àº11.5 MeV, using the Thick Target Inverse Kinematics technique. These measurements are discussed, with a focus on assessing their usefulness for investigating Œ±-clustering in medium mass 44,48,52-Ti nuclei.

  description: We review some of the key experimental and theoretical studies of Œ±-clustering in 18-F. Particular attention is given to the 4p-2h nature of such Œ±-clustered states, and the interaction between the holes and clusters is examined in terms of both weak and strong coupling regimes. The experimental work focuses on Œ±-transfer spectroscopy and Œ± resonant scattering as tools for investigating Œ±-clustering.

  description: Measurements were made of the differential cross section of the resonant reactions 4-He(14-N,Œ±) and, 4-He(14-N,d)16-O with the intention of investigating the compound nucleus 18-F. These measurements were performed in inverse kinematics at a center-of-mass scattering angle of Œ∏ =180 degrees by using a thick 4-He gas target and a 14-N beam. Data were recorded which covered 18-F excitation energies from 5.5‚Äì16 MeV. An R-matrix analysis was performed on the data up to 9 MeV, and the energies, spins, parities, and partial widths were extracted. Nine new states have been identified in 18-F based on this analysis between 8.326 and 8.915 MeV.
